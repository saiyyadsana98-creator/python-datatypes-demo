# Python Data Types Demo

## Objective
To understand Python data types, type conversion, error handling, and dynamic typing.

## Tools Used
- Python
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Work Done
- Declared variables of different data types
- Printed variable types using type()
- Performed arithmetic operations
- Converted string input to int and float
- Handled invalid input using try-except
- Demonstrated string concatenation
- Showed dynamic typing behavior

## Outcome
This task helped me understand how Python handles data, memory, and dynamic typing.
